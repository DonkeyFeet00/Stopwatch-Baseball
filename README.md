# Stopwatch-Baseball
The classic game of stopwatch baseball, but on the web!

**I am not looking for collaboration on this project.**

how the game is played:  

- each player takes turns attempting to stop the stopwatch as close to the target time as possible without going over.  
- if a player manages to stop the stopwatch within the few miliseconds before or exactly at 1 second, then they advance thier runners through the bases as below:  
    * .97 - single, batter and all runners advance a base  
    * .98 - double, batter and all runners advance 2 bases  
    * .99 - triple, batter and all runners advance 3 bases  
    * 1.00 - homerun, batter and all runners advance 4 bases  
- everytime that a runner makes it all the way around to homebase, the player scores a point  
- everytime that a player stops the stopwatch outside of these times, they get a strike. 3 strikes and they are out and its the next players turn!  
- after each player has had 9 attempts (innings) the game is over and whoever has the highest score wins!  

i do plan on eventually adding a baseball diamond to the page that will show what bases are "loaded" or empty, accessibility options like extending the timer and widening the scoring intervals. the first version however will likely just have 3 dots in a row representing the bases.
