# Stopwatch-Baseball
The classic game of stopwatch baseball, but on the web!

how the game is played:
    each player takes turns attempting to stop the stopwatch as close to the target time as possible without going over.
    if a player manages to stop the stopwatch within the few miliseconds before or exactly at 1 second, then they advance thier runners through the bases as below:
        .97 - single, batter and all runners advance a base
        .98 - double, batter and all runners advance 2 bases
        .99 - triple, batter and all runners advance 3 bases
        1.00 - homerun, batter and all runners advance 4 bases
    everytime that a runner makes it all the way around to homebase, the player scores a point
    everytime that a player stops the stopwatch outside of these times, they get a strike. 3 strikes and they are out and its the next players turn!
    after each player has had 9 attempts (innings) the game is over and whoever has the highest score wins!
